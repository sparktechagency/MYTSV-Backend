                        <p>Henry Cai, the proprietor of <strong>3 Little Pigs Chi</strong> in Chicago, operates without a physical storefront, opting for Instagram DMs to manage orders for his BBQ Chinese and fried chicken. Despite working in a modest 200-square-foot kitchen, his culinary creations draw visitors from afar, attesting to their popularity.</p>

                        <p>In an interview with MUNCHIES, Cai shares his journey of mastering cooking without prior restaurant experience, his perspective on success, and his vision for advancing Chinese American cuisine. Popular menu items include the salt and pepper chicken sandwich, 3LP fried rice, and smoked BBQ pork.</p>
